# Service Clusters
<p>This is where Service Clusters will reside (ex: Utility Service Cluster). Service Clusters are collections of unrelated, but 
categorical microservices. 
</br>
</br>
For example, Utility is the categorical archetype for collections of services such as Auth_Service or Notification_Service, in the Utility_Service_Cluister.</p>
